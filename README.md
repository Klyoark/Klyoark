- ğŸ‘‹ The name is PK, or Kly, or Klyoark, whatever handle you want to use. 
- ğŸ‘€ Interested in literally anything (aka undecided lol). 
- ğŸŒ± Began with C++, learning with C++, and using C++ (And some experience messing with Android).
- ğŸ“« Reach me via discord (@Klyoark9089), don't fully trust other socials with the same name/handle.
- âš¡ Fun fact:
    - Didn't plan to enter tech at first.
    - Did Miui Rom dev, but left cus did not feel rewarding mentally (but still maintaining some tools in limited free time).
